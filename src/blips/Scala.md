HMRC continues to make significant use of Scala. Other departments, such as DWP, are actively discouraging its use. Scala has a steeper learning curve, and produces code which is more concise but is harder to understand and maintain. Scala has less than 1% of the market vs 19% for Java â€“ therefore competent developers are a much more scarce and expensive resource than Java programmers. The trend seems to be that departments see insufficient advantages over Java 8 to justify the additional technical diversity, cost and complexity. However, as HMRC has become a more strategic target for Public Sector Digital we are moving Scala back into the active 'adopt' ring.
