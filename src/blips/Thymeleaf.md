Java library that aims to be a complete substitute for JSP. Templates are HTML-based with the objective that page resources created by front-end designers can be more directly reused as the basis of server-side templates by the back-end developer, reducing redundant conversion effort and clarifying the separation of duties. However, DWP trials indicate that in all but the most simple of cases these benefits are not realised. We're not seeing demand from the departments.
