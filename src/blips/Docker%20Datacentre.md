A paid-for on-prem or public cloud (VPC) CaaS platform from Docker Inc. It is a ready-integrated platform that leverages the wider Docker ecosystem with some propriatary features such as Docker UCP added on top.<br/></br>
We see more people migrate apps from on-prem datacentres to public cloud than we see trying to bring public cloud-like capabilities on-prem so we see that as a relatively niche use case.</br></br>
Equally, where clients are deploying to public cloud we're seeing lots of them leverage native PaaS features such as AWS ECS. Where clients don't want to couple themselves to a specific cloud provider we see big usage of standalone cluster managers such as Kubernetes.</br></br>
Where clients are happy to deploy an all-in-one integrated product suite similar to Docker Datacenter, either on-prem or in public cloud, OpenShift (which includes Kubernetes) is by far the most popular platform in this space and a free open source version is available.</br></br>
Docker Swarm is the core container scheduler within Docker Datacenter and is tracked separately on this radar.</br></br>
As such we don't currently intend to build a capability around Docker Datacenter. It is retained on the radar because this is a fast moving area that we will continue to monitor.
