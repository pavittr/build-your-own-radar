A paid-for cloud-hosted SaaS solution from Docker Inc. It leverages the extended Docker ecosystem to provision infra (e.g. AWS EC2, VPC, security groups, etc) and integrate with Docker Hub (another SaaS service) to pull images, deploy containers to that infra, then monitor and scale them out.</br></br>
It competes with platform features like AWS ECS (which unlike Docker Cloud adds no additional cost over and above the cost of the EC2 infra).</br></br>
We're not yet seeing any demand for this from clients and it has minimal traction in industry so we don't expect to build a capability around it. We retain a watch on it in the radar.
